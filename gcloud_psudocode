usage="

This is concept code for the level 3 or 4 wrapper script to bring up a network of machines in a new project.  The arguments it will 
need to take from the command line are: project, zone, servertype, and number of servers/clients

The heavy lifting won't be done here, but in a python script and a 'server/client' config file.

if [ $# == 0 ]; then
   echo $usage
   exit 0;
fi

so, actually... the cases I want are:
   * Create new project
   * Create new instance
   * Create new instances





may want to itterate here... instead of using $* case statements.  Most importantly, I want to look for kerberose, ngix, ldap and
dns servers first, so I can bring them up first.

case "$*" in

-ldapserver)       echo "creating an ldap server"
                   ;;
-nfsserver)        echo "creating an nfs server"
                   ;;
-dnsserver)        echo "creating a dns server"
                   ;;
-clients)          echo "creating an ubuntu client"
                   ;;
-kerberoseserver)  echo "creating a kerberose server"
                   ;;
-nginxserver)      echo "creating a nginx server"
                   ;;
-djangoserver)     echo "creating a django server"
                   ;;
-postgresserver)   echo "creating a postgres server"
                   ;;
