usage="

This is concept code for the level 3 or 4 wrapper script to bring up a network of machines in a new project.  The arguments it will 
need to take from the command line are: project, zone, servertype, and number of servers/clients

The heavy lifting won't be done here, but in a python script and a 'server/client' config file.
